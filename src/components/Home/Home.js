          <p>
            Originally from Diamond Bar, California, I entered college at the
            tender age of 14 through Cal State LA's Early Entrance Program and
            transferred to NYU to pursue bigger dreams. I spent my senior fall
            abroad in Shanghai studying calligraphy and dance to expand my
            cultural palate and explore the riveting facets of Chinese culture.
          </p>

            Previously, I wrote code at JPMorgan under the investment banking
            division. I also taught Data Structures and Algorithms during the
            school year and helped organize the 2019 and 2020 cycles of HackNYU.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a diverse repertoire of interests that include playing chess,
            writing about my experiences, hosting a podcast, and making YouTube
            videos. I also love absorbing nature through hiking and photography.
