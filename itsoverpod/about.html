					<h1>About</h1>
					<span class="image left"><img src="images/rich_and_pat.jpg" alt="Richard and Patrick" /></span>
					<p>What's up fam. Richard Shu and Patrick Ma go <em>way</em> back to elementary school. We met each other in 5th grade and did a lot of activities together including swim, tennis, debate, trombone, Team Fortress 2, and Monday book club. We even trick-or-treated together every year...</p>
					<p>Anyways, we started this podcast as a fun side project to reconnect with our buddies and meet new friends. Every episode, we'll have a rotating guest with a unique story to share. Hope you'll join us for the ride.</p>
					<p>Fun facts: Richard likes pineapple on pizza and Patrick does his own laundry.</p>
